# Paper Implementation

This repository contains implementations of various research papers. All notebooks can be run directly on Google Colab.

- [**A Neural Algorithm of Artistic Style**](./A_Neural_Algorithm_of_Artistic_Style/) - Uses deep neural networks to separate and recombine content and style of arbitrary images, enabling artistic style transfer between images.

- [**Generative Adversarial Nets**](./Generative_Adversarial_Nets/) - Introduces a framework for training generative models via a game between a generator and a discriminator, leading to powerful generative capabilities.

- [**Unsupervised Representation Learning with Deep Convoluntional Generative Adversial Networks**](./Deep_convolutional_GAN/) - Demonstrates how convolutional architectures can be applied to GANs, improving training stability and image generation quality.
